## Component Breakdown

### Core Components
1. **FormBuilder**: Reusable form component for both invoices and proposals
2. **PreviewPane**: Real-time preview of the document being created
3. **AIAssistantWidget**: Interface for AI interactions
4. **TemplateSelector**: Component for browsing and selecting templates
5. **PDFControls**: Controls for generating and managing PDFs
6. **NavigationMenu**: App navigation
7. **ActionButtons**: Standardized action buttons across the app

### Pages
1. **Dashboard**: Overview and quick actions
2. **InvoiceCreation**: New invoice creation
3. **InvoiceEdit**: Edit existing invoice
4. **ProposalCreation**: New proposal creation
5. **ProposalEdit**: Edit existing proposal
6. **TemplateManagement**: Template creation and management
7. **DocumentPreview**: Preview before finalization

## Data Flow
1. User inputs data through forms
2. Data is validated and stored in application state
3. Preview is updated in real-time
4. On save, data is stored in local storage
5. On generate, PDF is created from the data
6. Templates are applied by merging template data with user input

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all core components
- Integration tests for form submission and PDF generation
- End-to-end tests for complete user flows
- Cross-browser and responsive design testing
- Performance testing for large documents

## Success Criteria
- Average document creation time < 5 minutes
- AI assistant usage > 50%
- Template reuse rate > 70%
- User satisfaction score > 4.5/5
- Error rate < 1%

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
